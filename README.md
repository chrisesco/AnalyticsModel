# AnalyticsModel

In this project you will find some of the answers raised in the following blog.

What I have done is to start from the view created in the blog, I have added the entities that allow to give answers to the author's questions.

The answers are implemented in SQL queries, but if you have access to SAP Analytics Cloud, just consume the model and create a graph that allows to answer the questions.

I hope this can serve as a guide for you.
